<br> 
<br>In the event a Chargeback is performed, your User Account may be blocked without the option to re-purchase or re-use it, and any data contained in such User Account, including any domains, applications and Third Party Services may be subject to cancellation and Capacity Loss (as defined in Section 6.3 below).

<br> 
<br>If you have any questions or concerns regarding a payment made to eSpider, we encourage you to first contact our Customer Support team before filing a Chargeback or reversal of payment, in order to prevent the eSpider Services from being cancelled and your User Account being blocked, and to avoid the filing of an unwarranted or erroneous Chargeback, which may result in your being liable for its applicable Fees, in addition to re-payment of all the Fees applicable to the eSpider Services purchased (and charged-back) by you.
<br>We reserve our right to dispute any Chargeback received, including by providing the relevant credit card company or financial institution with any information and documentation proving that the User responsible for such Chargeback did in fact authorize the transaction and make use of the services rendered thereafter.
<br>
